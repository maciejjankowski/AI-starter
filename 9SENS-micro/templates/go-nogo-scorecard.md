## Example: Pet Snake Subscription Box

### Scores

| Dimension | Weight | Score | Weighted | Rationale |
|-----------|--------|-------|----------|-----------|
| Market Attractiveness | 25% | 5/10 | 1.25 | Small niche (75K addressable), steady 8% growth, but mature market |
| Financial Viability | 30% | 4/10 | 1.20 | LTV/CAC 2.95x (below 3x target), 24mo payback, 40% margins acceptable |
| Technical Feasibility | 15% | 8/10 | 1.20 | Low complexity, dropship model, 1-2 months to MVP, minimal risk |
| Strategic Positioning | 30% | 7/10 | 2.10 | Weak as standalone, strong as platform. Timing good. Moat via community. |
| **TOTAL** | 100% | — | **5.75 / 10** | **57.5 / 100** |

### Decision

**Score**: 57.5 / 100
**Recommendation**: **PIVOT**

**Rationale**:
- Market too small for standalone subscription (scores 5/10)
- Financial viability weak without upsells (scores 4/10)
- BUT: Technical feasibility high (8/10) + Strategic positioning good (7/10)
- **Pivot**: From subscription-only to platform (subscription + consumables + marketplace)

**Critical Assumptions**:
1. Snake owners will buy consumables online (validate: survey 50 owners)
2. Community engagement improves retention (validate: build forum, track metrics)
3. Marketplace commission model generates sufficient margin (validate: research breeder willingness)

**Next Steps**:
- [ ] Survey 50 snake owners (1 week, $50)
- [ ] Build MVP subscription + basic consumables store (2 months, $5K)
- [ ] Test for 3 months, measure retention + upsell conversion
- [ ] If retention >50% + upsell >20% → scale platform
- [ ] If not → kill

## Tips for Accurate Scoring

### Don't Inflate Scores

**Common mistake**: Scoring 8/10 because "it feels good"

**Better approach**: Use the scoring guides strictly
- If LTV/CAC is 2.5x → Score 5/10 (not 7/10)
- If market is $50M → Score 3/10 (not 6/10)

Be honest. Inflated scores lead to bad decisions.

### Weight Your Confidence

If you scored 8/10 but confidence is only 50%:
- Effective score = 8 × 0.50 = 4
- Flag this dimension for validation

### Resolve Conflicts

If personas disagree:
- BILL says market is 5/10
- STEVE says strategic is 8/10
- You can't just average → investigate WHY they differ

**Example**:
- BILL: "Market is small (5/10)"
- STEVE: "But adjacent market is huge, pivot opportunity (8/10)"
- Resolution: Score current market 5/10, but note pivot potential in rationale

### Document Everything

Don't just write scores. Document:
- Why this score?
- What data supports it?
- What would change the score?
- What assumptions are baked in?

---

## When to Re-Score

**Re-score if**:
- ✅ You validated critical assumptions (update confidence)
- ✅ Market conditions changed (competitor shut down, new entrant)
- ✅ You pivoted strategy (subscription → platform)
- ✅ You got new data (user survey, financial model update)

**Don't re-score**:
- ❌ Just because you want it to be viable
- ❌ To justify a decision you already made
- ❌ Without new data/validation

## Spreadsheet Version

Want automatic calculation? Copy this to Google Sheets:

```
| Dimension | Weight | Score | Formula | Weighted |
|-----------|--------|-------|---------|----------|
| Market | 0.25 | [B2] | =B2*A2 | [C2] |
| Financial | 0.30 | [B3] | =B3*A3 | [C3] |
| Technical | 0.15 | [B4] | =B4*A4 | [C4] |
| Strategic | 0.30 | [B5] | =B5*A5 | [C5] |
| TOTAL | 1.00 | — | =SUM(C2:C5)*10 | [C6] |
```

Then add conditional formatting:
- Green: ≥70
- Yellow: 50-69
- Red: <50
